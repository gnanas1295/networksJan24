For using the playbook in the git hub page you need to have any index.html file in the respective path mentioned in the Playbook. index.html can be created by self or you can use the one that I have created from the below mentioned git hub path.
Git File path for the Playbook: https://github.com/gnanas1295/fitness_site

Note: This playbook can run with just ansible software installed in your machine, installation of the docker along with creation of the contianers is done by the playbook itself.
